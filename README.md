# fprose-tools

This project contains tooling to support the fprose file format, a minimal
markdown-like language for writing prose.

"fprose" stands for "foldable prose", because the format encourages the author
to maintain both structural groupings (act, chapter, etc) and semantics markers
(in the form of comments).  It's designed so that editors can provide easy and
dynamic "code folding" (hiding and revealing parts of the document).
